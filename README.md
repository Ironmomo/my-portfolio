# Portfolio Website

Welcome to my portfolio website repository! This project showcases my web development skills through a modern, responsive, and performant website.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**  
- **CSS**  
- **JavaScript**  
- **WebPack**  
- **GSAP**  

## About the Project

I am enthusiastic about **web design** and wanted to create a modern and **responsive** web design for my portfolio.

To achieve high performance and maintainability, I utilized **webpack** for module bundling and development workflow enhancement. Additionally, I integrated **GSAP** to create smooth and creative animations.

## Features

- Responsive and modern UI/UX
- Webpack for optimized asset bundling
- Smooth animations with GSAP
- Clean and maintainable code structure
